api call in js
---------------
AJAX - asynchronous js xml

-XMLhttp
-fetch
-asynch await



useEffect-its an hook


redirection in react
--------------------
react-router-dom
    -npm i react-router-dom


    import { BrowserRouter as Router - all routing need components
    ,Routes-                         - to set paths for each components
    ,Route                           -used when have more than one path
     } from 'react-router-dom';

     useParams  - hook used to access params from component url


     REDUX
     ------

     coupling   - many connections between parent and child component

     props drilling - In coupling , if any intermediate component have any errors
      all other childs will not work 

    to avoid props drilling we need to reduce coupling and make all the components independant

    for this react introduced a new technology - state management tecnology - REDUX



redux process
-------------
create a new js file to keep the states, all the component can access the js file

- the components only can access the datas from the js file
  but they cant update datas in js file

- Action -> a file where all the logics to update the state
-Dispatch ->method used to Dispatch the logic in action file when the component need state updation
-Reducer ->update the datas in js file according to the paylod response to get from action file  


libraries to apply redux
-------------------------


1.REDUX
2.REACT-REDUX
3.REDUX-THUNK
        npm i redux react-redux redux-thunk

createStore() - method in REDUX used to create store in js file
              -2 args
              1.reducer 
              2.middleware - used to make synchronous redux into asynchronous

applyMiddleware() - method in REDUX to apply middleware

combineReducers() - mthod in REDUX used to combine all the reducers in js file


thunk - in REDUX_THUNK ,used to create middleware

1. create store 
2. apply store in index.js     
        -provider    - its a tag used to pass the store(react-redux)
